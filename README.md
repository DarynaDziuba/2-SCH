# 2-SCH
This is 2-step construction heuristic for capacitated lot sizing problems.

We provide three versions of the algorithm:
- 2-SCH for single-level CLSP
- 2-SCH for single-level CLSP with backorders
- 2-SCH for multi-level CLSP

All versions are suitable for problems without and with setup times.

We also provide the code to simulate online production planning for the single-level CLSP (2-SCH for CLSP Online Setting).

Test instances for CLSP without and with setup times and for MLCLSP are to be found in the respective folders.
